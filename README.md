# Data Visualization Project

## Data
This is the "U.S. Metro Areas Violent Crime Rates by Type" dataset. Originally published at [data.world](https://data.world/carlvlewis/u-s-metro-areas-violent-crime-rates-by-type-1970-2015). 

## Prototypes

I’ve created a proof of concept visualization of this data. It's a bar chart  and it shows the relationship between crime rates by type and cities.

(please put a screenshot of one or more visualizations of this dataset you already made, for previous assignments)

## Questions & Tasks

The following tasks and questions will drive the visualization and interaction decisions for this project:

 * How does overall crime rate vary over time?
 * Is there any correlation between time and crime rate in each city?
 * What is the most dangerous area in each year?
 

## Sketches

(insert one or more hand-drawn sketches of interactive visualizations that you imagine)
(describe each sketch - how is the data visualized, what are the interactions, and how do these relate to the questions/tasks)

## Open Questions

(describe any fear, uncertainty, or doubt you’re having about the feasibility of implementing the sketched system. For example, “I’m not sure where to get the geographic shapes to build a map from this data” or “I don’t know how to resolve the codes to meaningful names” … Feel free to delete this section if you’re confident.)
