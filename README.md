# Data Visualization Project

## Data
This is the "U.S. Metro Areas Violent Crime Rates by Type" dataset. Originally published at [data.world](https://data.world/carlvlewis/u-s-metro-areas-violent-crime-rates-by-type-1970-2015). 

## Prototypes

Iâ€™ve created a proof of concept visualization of this data. It's a bar chart  and it shows the relationship between crime rates by type and cities.

(please put a screenshot of one or more visualizations of this dataset you already made, for previous assignments)

## Questions & Tasks

The following tasks and questions will drive the visualization and interaction decisions for this project:

 * How does overall crime rate vary over time?
 * Is there any correlation between time and crime rate in each city?
 * What is the most dangerous area in each year?
 

## Sketches

This sketche displays the idea on how I will explore the correlation between crime rate in each place and year in my project.
The color reflects numerical size of crime rate, and there will have a drop down menu for year selection.

## Ideas for interaction
Follow the idea of [linked line chart & choropleth](http://curran.github.io/model/examples/d3LinkedChoropleth/), I will design a crime map that can illustrate the relation between crime rate and states with changing of the year. 

## Schedule of Deliverables
1. Reduction of data:



estimated delivery time: 10/6



tasks:
aggerate data based on time and department.

2. Visualize graphes for question 1:


estimated delivery time: 10/12



tasks:
based on the aggerated data, draw a graph that displays the relation between overall crime rate and year.

3. Visualize graphes for question 2:


estimated delivery time: 10/19


tasks:
based on the aggerated data, visualize year vs different types of crime in each city.

4. create a crime map:

estimated delivery time: 10/26


tasks:
Realize the idea proposed in ideas for interaction.

5. Finalize everything and write a report:


estimated delivery time: 10/30


tasks:
Provenance and cleanliness.
