# Data Visualization Final Project

## Data
This is the "U.S. Metro Areas Violent Crime Rates by Type" dataset. Originally published at [data.world](https://data.world/carlvlewis/u-s-metro-areas-violent-crime-rates-by-type-1970-2015). Datasets can be found [here](https://gist.github.com/yyaaa1/2a71bdf8de2d1fb6bcf02ee19e2d7322).

## Questions & Tasks

The following tasks and questions will drive the visualization and interaction decisions for this project:

 * How does overall crime rate vary over time?
 * Is there any correlation between time and crime rate in each city?
 * What is the most dangerous area in each year?



## Completed Work
1. The first visualization shows the relationship between year and overall crime rate.

## Future Work
Adding a dropdown menu in the crime map so users can view the distribution of crimes in different year.
