# Data Visualization Project

## Data
This is the "U.S. Metro Areas Violent Crime Rates by Type" dataset. Originally published at [data.world](https://data.world/carlvlewis/u-s-metro-areas-violent-crime-rates-by-type-1970-2015). 

## Prototypes

I’ve created a proof of concept visualization of this data. It's a bar chart  and it shows the relationship between crime rates by type and cities.

(please put a screenshot of one or more visualizations of this dataset you already made, for previous assignments)

## Questions & Tasks

The following tasks and questions will drive the visualization and interaction decisions for this project:

 * How does overall crime rate vary over time?
 * Is there any correlation between time and crime rate in each city?
 * What is the most dangerous area in each year?
 

## Sketches

This sketche displays the idea on how I will explore the correlation between crime rate in each place and year in my project.
The color reflects numerical size of crime rate, and there will have a drop down menu for year selection.

## Open Questions

I’m not sure how to create a map to realize the sketche above.
