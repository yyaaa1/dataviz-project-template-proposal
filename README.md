# Data Visualization Project

## Data
This is the "U.S. Metro Areas Violent Crime Rates by Type" dataset. Originally published at [data.world](https://data.world/carlvlewis/u-s-metro-areas-violent-crime-rates-by-type-1970-2015). Datasets can be found [here](https://gist.github.com/yyaaa1/2a71bdf8de2d1fb6bcf02ee19e2d7322).

## Questions & Tasks

The following tasks and questions will drive the visualization and interaction decisions for this project:

 * How does overall crime rate vary over time?
 * Is there any correlation between time and crime rate in each city?
 * What is the most dangerous area in each year?
 

## Sketches

This sketche displays the idea on how I will explore the correlation between crime rate in each place and year in my project.
The color reflects numerical size of crime rate, and there will have a drop down menu for year selection.

## Ideas for interaction
Follow the idea of [linked line chart & choropleth](http://curran.github.io/model/examples/d3LinkedChoropleth/), I will design a crime map that can illustrate the relation between crime rate and states with changing of the year.

tasks:
aggregate data based on time and department. (status: completed, run crime_rate_vs_year.py to aggregate data)

2. Visualize graphes for question 1:


estimated delivery time: 10/12

tasks:
based on the aggerated data, draw a graph that displays the relation between overall crime rate and year. (status: completed, used crime_rate_vs_years.csv to visualize this relationship. The graph can be found [here](https://beta.vizhub.com/yyaaa1/a975c64447644bf693f5bdf514303782?edit=files))

3. Visualize graphes for question 2:


estimated delivery time: 10/19


tasks:
based on the aggerated data, visualize year vs different types of crime in each city.

4. create a crime map:

estimated delivery time: 10/26


tasks:
Realize the idea proposed in ideas for interaction.

5. Finalize everything and write a report:


estimated delivery time: 10/30


tasks:
Provenance and cleanliness.
